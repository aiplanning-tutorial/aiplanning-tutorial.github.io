    <h1>IJCAI2021 Tutorial on AI Planning: Theory and Practice</h1>
    <h2>Aug 19 10:00 – 16:00 Montreal Time (UTC-4) </h2>

    <h2>Shirin Sohrabi, Michael Katz, Octavian Udrea </h2> <br>

    <h2>A two-sentence description of the tutorial:</h2>
    <p>The tutorial provides a theoretical background on AI Planning and introduces some of the existing tools, as well as existing applications that were tackled with these tools. We show how to use the tools on an example application. The participants will get the knowledge and hands-on experience necessary to start using AI Planning tools in their applications.</p>
    <h2>A two-paragraph description of the tutorial, suitable for a web page overview:</h2>
    <p>AI Planning is a long standing sub-area of AI. Planning applications can be found in dialog systems, cybersecurity, transportation and logistics, as well as IT. Yet, applying AI Planning research in practice faces several challenges, preventing its widespread use. The aim of this tutorial is to provide the audience with the necessary theoretical background knowledge, as well as hands-on experience to allow for using planning tools for solving everyday challenges.</p>
    <p>In this tutorial, we will provide an overview of the field of planning, including recent advances in the field. We will then dive into three challenges: (1) modeling – how to represent, extract, and learn the knowledge; (2) theory – formal definition of the computational problems; (3) tooling – how to solve the computational problems. We will have a hands-on session to exemplify the use of planning tools for solving an example application. Our aim is to give IJCAI attendees the necessary means for using AI planning tools in their applications.</p>

    <h2>A brief characterization of the potential target audience for the tutorial, including prerequisite knowledge.</h2>
    <p>Potential target audience are researchers from outside the field of planning, most of the typical IJCAI attendees. No prior knowledge is necessary, since we plan to cover all the necessary background. In particular, we hope that researchers with no prior exposure to AI Planning will find our tutorial interesting and motivating for their work.</p>
    <h2>A brief description of why the tutorial topic should be of interest to a substantial part of the IJCAI audience, and which of the above objectives are best served by the tutorial.</h2>
    <p>Our main goal is to give the attendees the necessary knowledge and experience so that they can start using AI Planning tools in their applications. We plan to cover several applications of AI Planning, challenges, and solutions and give the attendees a hands-on experience of using planning tools in one of these applications.</p>
    <p>The following objectives fit out tutorial:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Educate experts or non experts to established but specialized AI methodologies</li>
    <li>Introduce expert non-specialists to an AI area</li>
    </ol>
