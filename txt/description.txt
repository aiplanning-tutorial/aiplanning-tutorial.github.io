AI Planning is a long-standing sub-area of AI, dealing with sequential
decision making, a sister field to Reinforcement Learning. Mature industrial
applications of planning technology can be seen in various fields, such as
dialog systems, cybersecurity, transportation and logistics, as well as IT.
While model-based planning tools allow to solve problems of practical size, applying AI 
planning research in practice faces several challenges, preventing its
widespread use. The alternative of using model-free methods, however, often
proves infeasible for real-life size problems.
The aim of this tutorial is to provide the audience with the
necessary theoretical background knowledge, as well as hands-on experience to
allow for using planning tools for solving everyday challenges.

In this tutorial, we will provide an overview of the field of planning,
including recent advances in the field. We will then dive into three challenges:
(1) modeling: how to represent, extract, and learn the knowledge; 
(2) theory: formal definition of the computational problems; 
(3) tooling: how to solve the computational problems. 

We will have a hands-on session to exemplify the use of
planning tools for solving an example application. Our aim is to give AAAI
attendees the necessary means for using AI planning tools in their applications.
